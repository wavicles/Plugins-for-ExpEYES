ExpEYES Program 
Developed as a part of GSoC Project "Plugins-for-ExpEYES"

Program to plot lissajous figures using sin and phase diff added using capacitor.
connect sin ti A1 and a 1 microfarad capacitor from A1 to A2. Connect 1K resistor from A2 to GND. Capture voltage before and after the capacitor.
